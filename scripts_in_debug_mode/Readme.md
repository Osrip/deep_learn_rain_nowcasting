These Scripts can be run in debug mode at certain positions of the code. (Copy + Paste)

The scripts indicate where they can be run, and some places in the code also reference these scripts

E.g. they are used for quick & dirty plotting, debugging etc.
Very helpful to get a feeling what is going on in  the pipeline.
